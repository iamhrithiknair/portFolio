        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A man with a vision currently on a mission. Hola! Myself Hrithik Manoj Nair. A technology and gaming enthusiast currently pursuing BTech in
        Information Technology at <a href = "http://www.gecbh.ac.in/" target ="_blank">GEC Barton Hill</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My experience in the technological and gaming worlds has been nothing short of thrilling. I have a deep respect for the limitless possibilities that technology offers, from my first days of messing with computers to my exploration of the immersive worlds 
            of video games.
            <br>
            One aspect that has particularly captured my attention is the captivating realm of Artificial Intelligence. 
            The idea that machines can simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that were once considered science fiction has always fascinated me. I find myself deeply engrossed in the world of AI, constantly exploring its vast possibilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            I find the complex network of rules and policies that mold our society to be equally fascinating as technology. 
            I regularly participate in conversations and provide viewpoints on these issues because I want to help bring about change.
        </p>

        <p>
            International affairs and issues of national importance are other interests of mine. 
            I'm devoted to learning how our country functions intricately and how it interacts with the rest of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Above everything else, I am a devoted citizen of my country, India(üáÆüá≥). 
            I work to have a significant impact on the world around me using a combination of technology, intelligence, and a sense of duty.
